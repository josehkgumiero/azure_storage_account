You are planning the deployment of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

You have the following two reports that will access the data lake:

Report1: Reads three columns from a file that contains 50 columns.

Report2: Queries a single record based on a timestamp.

You need to recommend in which format to store the data in the data lake to support the reports. The solution must minimize read times.

What should you recommend for each report? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

Report 1:
- Avro
- CSV
- Parquet
- TSV

Report 2:

- Parquet
- TSV

- a) Report1 - CSV, Report2 - Parquet
- b) Report1 - Avro, Report2 - Parquet
- c) Report1 - CSV, Report2 - Avro
- d) Report1 - Parquet, Report2 - CSV
