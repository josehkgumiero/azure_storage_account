# Configure object replication for block blobs

Object replication asynchronously copies block blobs between a source storage account and a destination account. When you configure object replication, you create a replication policy that specifies the source storage account and the destination account. A replication policy includes one or more rules that specify a source container and a destination container and indicate which block blobs in the source container will be replicated.
