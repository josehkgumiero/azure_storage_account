# View from a storage account

To access VM insights directly from a storage account:

- In the Azure portal, select Storage accounts.
- From the list, choose a storage account. In the Monitoring section, choose Insights.

On the Overview workbook for the storage account, it shows several storage performance metrics that help you quickly assess:

- Health of the Storage service to immediately see if an issue outside of your control is affecting the Storage service in the region it is deployed to, which is stated under the Summary column.

- Interactive performance charts showing the most essential details related to storage capacity, availability, transactions, and latency.

- Metric and status tiles highlighting service availability, total count of transactions to the storage service, E2E latency, and server latency.
