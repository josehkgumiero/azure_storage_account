# Azure built-in roles for blobs
######
Azure RBAC provides several built-in roles for authorizing access to blob data using Azure AD and OAuth. Some examples of roles that provide permissions to data resources in Azure Storage include:

- Storage Blob Data Owner: Use to set ownership and manage POSIX access control for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. For more information, see Access control in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- Storage Blob Data Contributor: Use to grant read/write/delete permissions to Blob storage resources
- Storage Blob Data Reader: Use to grant read-only permissions to Blob storage resources.
- Storage Blob Delegator: Get a user delegation key to use to create a shared access signature that is signed with Azure AD credentials for a container or blob.
