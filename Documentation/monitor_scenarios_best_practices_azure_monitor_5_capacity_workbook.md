# Capacity workbook

Select Capacity at the top of the page and the Capacity workbook opens. It shows you the amount of total storage used in the account and capacity used by each data service in the account to help identify over and under utilized storage.

There is conditional color-coding or heatmaps for columns in the workbook that report capacity metrics with a blue value. The deepest color has the highest value and a lighter color is based on the lowest values.

When you select a value under any one of the columns in the workbook, you drill down to the Capacity workbook for the storage account. Further details about the drill-down report are described in the Detailed storage workbooks section below.
