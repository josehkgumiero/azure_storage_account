# Customize Storage insights

This section highlights common scenarios for editing the workbook to customize in support of your data analytics needs:

- Scope the workbook to always select a particular subscription or storage account(s)
- Change metrics in the grid
- Change the availability threshold
- Change the color rendering

The customizations are saved to a custom workbook to prevent overwriting the default configuration in our published workbook. Workbooks are saved within a resource group, either in the My Reports section that's private to you or in the Shared Reports section that's accessible to everyone with access to the resource group. After you save the custom workbook, you need to go to the workbook gallery to launch it.
