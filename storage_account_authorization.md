# Storage Account Authorization

#####

Each time you access data in your storage account, your client application makes a request over HTTP/TTPS to Azure Storage. By default, every resource in Azure Storage is secured, and every request to a secure resource must be authorized. Authorization ensures that the client application has the apropriate permissions to access a particular resource in your storage account.
