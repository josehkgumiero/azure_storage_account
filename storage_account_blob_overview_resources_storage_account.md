# Storage accounts
- A storage account provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data. 
- Every object that you store in Azure Storage has an address that includes your unique account name. 
- The combination of the account name and the Blob Storage endpoint forms the base address for the objects in your storage account.
- For example, if your storage account is named mystorageaccount, then the default endpoint for Blob Storage is: http://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net
