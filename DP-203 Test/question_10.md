Scenario: You are working at OZcorp which is a multi-million dollar company run by Mayor Norman Osborn. Profits from the company are used to fund Normanâ€™s operatives, such as a police task force. You have been hired by OZcorp as a Microsoft Azure Expert.

At the moment, the team is designing the folder structure for an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container where OZcorp users will query data by using a variety of services including Azure Databricks and Azure Synapse Analytics serverless SQL pools. The data will be secured by subject area. Most queries will include data from the current year or current month.

As the Azure expert, which folder structure should you recommend to support fast queries and simplified folder security?

c)/{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}/{SubjectArea}/{DataSource}/{FileData}_{YYYY}_{MM}_{DD}.csv
d)/{DD}/{MM}/{YYYY}/{SubjectArea}/{DataSource}/{FileData}_{YYYY}_{MM}_{DD}.csv
