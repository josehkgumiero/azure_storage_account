Scenario: You are working on a project and there are two video files stored as blobs.

Video 1: business-critical; requires a replication policy that creates multiple copies across geographically diverse datacentres

Video 2: non-business-critical; local replication policy is sufficient

Which of the following options would satisfy both data diversity and cost sensitivity consideration?

a) None of the listed options.
b) Create a single storage account tht makes use of local-redundant storage (LRS) and host both videos fom here
c) Create a single store account that makes use of Geo-redundant storage (GRS) and host both videos from here.
d) Create two storage accounts. THe first account makes use of Geo-redundant storage (GRS) and hosts the business-critical video content. THe second account makes use of local-redundant storage (LRS) and hosts the non-critical video content.



Correct: D
